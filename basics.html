    <h2>Basics</h2>
    <p>You are here, bacause you would like to program your own game – but you don't know how to get started?
    Perhaps you have never even programmed anything before and you are worried that writing code may not be your thing?</p>

    <p>I'm telling you: it's not hard, really.</p> 
    <p>Also, "Instant Rocket Fuel" will provide you with a foundation and some building blocks – like Lego – that you can use to build your game, such that you only need to focus on the stuff that is specific to your game. The parts that are fun.</p>

    <p>Yet, there is nothing in Instant Rocket fuel that you absolutely <em>have</em> to use. You can use some of the parts and choose to provide others yourself. Its all just there to help you get your game off the ground. In the end, it is all just JavaScript, and the HTML Canvas Element.</p>

    <h2>The Game Loop</h2>

    <p>First off, you'll need some kind of game loop</p>
    
    <pre><code>

      class Asteroids extends Game

        constructor: (width, height) ->
          super width, height

        update: ->
          super()
          @batman.update @timer.delta

        render: ->
          @ctx.clearRect 0, 0, @width, @height
          super()

      $ ->
        asteroids = new Asteroids( 1024, 768 )
        asteroids.start()
      
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Time based vs. Frame based games</h2>
    <p>This is work in progress and im currently still writing on this section. Please be patient and come back later</p>
